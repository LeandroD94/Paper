Abstract
Background Gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is affected in approximately 90% of systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients from the earliest disease stages. Microbiota has recently emerged as an important environmental factor in SSc pathogenesis.

Objectives to test differences in the taxa composition of the fecal microbiota of very early SSc (VEDOSS) and established SSc patients.

Methods Twenty-nine SSc patients classified according to the ACR/EULAR 2013 criteria (27 female, mean ± SD disease duration 13.1±9.2 years) and 21 VEDOSS patients (19 female, mean± SD disease duration 6.4±5.2 years) were consecutively enrolled. For each patient, demographic, clinical and laboratoristic data were recorded and stool samples were collected. GI involvement and quality of life were investigated with UCLA-Gastrointestinal Tract Questionnaire (GIT)2.0 and Short Form Health Survey-36 (SF36). Microbiota was assessed through 16S rRNA Next Generation Gene-Sequencing analysis.

Results We found a different fecal microbiota profile between SSc and VEDOSS. In particular, classes of Bacilli and Choriobacteria, orders of Desulfovibrionales and Lactobacillales, the family of Eggerthellaceae, the genera Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Sutterella and Uncultured-Rhodospirillales were statistically significant increased in SSc, while the class of Clostridia, the family of Oscillospiraceae and the order UCG-002 were statistically significant increased in VEDOSS.
