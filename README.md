Hi everyone!

In this repository I store and share the scripts that I used to analyse the data of the scientific publications where I'm involved. At this regard, it is worth to mention that the professor Matteo Ramazzotti (my PhD tutor) cooperated in the design of most of those analyses scripts.

The folder names begin with the year of publication (NB: this is often different from the year in which the script and the analyses have been performed) and reports a quick summary of the paper topic and/or its first author name.
In particular, in each folder of this repository the following files are always featured:
* "Paper title and info" --> with the title, DOI, authors and abstract of the paper;
* Linux or R scripts that have been used.

Through the informations provided and, naturally, the paper title or DOI, it is possible to easily find on PUBMED the paper where also the raw sequences GEO/SRA code is reported (it is always provided in "Data availability" section of our papers if the analyses regards the microbiome, otherwise a RData with every matrix necessary is featured in this repository folder).
Therefore, by obtaining those raw data and using the uploaded scripts, any user can reproduce and check every published results (and also get more information or alternative aesthetics of the plots!)

Finally, I'm always available through my e-mail (leandro.di.gloria@gmail.com) if any further information is required.
