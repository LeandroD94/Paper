### Abstract ###
The biological treatment of hypersaline wastewater (i.e., more than 35 g/L total dissolved solids (TDS), mainly NaCl) is challenging.
Several industries (food, pharmaceutical, oil, gas, tannery and textile) generate streams rich in both salt and organic content.
For this reason, new sustainable and inexpensive technology is needed.
This study used a sample of sediments from a marine solar salter as inoculum for a Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) treating synthetic wastewater with sodium acetate and yeast extract as organic substrates and a NaCl concentration of 110 g/L.
A thriving halophilic microbial community, dominated by the Halomonas genus, was successfully enriched.
After 583 days of the experiment, a maximum Organic Loading Rate (OLR) of 1.59±0.07 gCOD/L*day, an Organic Removal Rate (ORR) of 1.48±0.07 gCOD/L*day, and a corresponding removal efficiency of 93.24% were achieved.
One of the most commonly observed problems when treating biological hypersaline wastewater is poor biomass settling.
However, the enriched biomass displayed settling capacity in the initial period (until day 79 day), which was later lost during the course of the experiment.
Moreover, the microbial community was characterised mainly by filamentous microorganisms, contradicting the common observation in the literature of their scarcity or absence.
The findings obtained from this study could be a relevant contribution to future research related to the biological treatment of hypersaline effluents.
