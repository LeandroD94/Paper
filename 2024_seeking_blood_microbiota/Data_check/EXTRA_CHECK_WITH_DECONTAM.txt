Escherichia-Shigella Cutibacterium Clostridia_UCG-014 Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum NA_ f Xanthobacteraceae Bacteroides Bifidobacterium Roseburia Alistipes NA_ f Lachnospiraceae Christensenellaceae_R-7_group Subdoligranulum Sphingomonas

Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia Leifsonia Akkermansia Ruminococcus Helicobacter Pseudomonas Flavobacterium Lactobacillus Phascolarctobacterium Lachnospiraceae_ND3007_group Prevotella Coprococcus
 
NB: The remaining genera are Burkholderia, Leifsonia, Flavobacterium... and other genera which are VERY abundant in controls...
